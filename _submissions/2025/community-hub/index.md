Finding a cool place is just the start. What makes it great is the people you meet there. Community Hub adds social features to help youth connect.

## Core Features

### Interest-Based Groups

- Join groups for things you're into (robotics, basketball, art, etc.)
- See which third spaces host your group's activities
- Plan meetups with other group members

### Event Planning

- Create events at third spaces
- Invite friends or open it to your interest groups
- RSVP system so you know who's coming
- Adults/staff can verify and support events

### Safe Messaging

- Chat with other verified youth users
- Moderated spaces to keep conversations safe
- Block and report features
- No direct messaging from strangers

## Safety First

We know parents worry about online connections. That's why we built in:

- Age verification during signup
- Parental approval options for younger users
- Staff-monitored group chats at each location
- No sharing of personal contact info through the app

## The Vision

We want Third Spaces to feel like YOUR space. When you walk into the library or rec center, you should already know some people there. Community Hub makes that happen by connecting youth before they even show up.
