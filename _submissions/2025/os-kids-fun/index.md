Meet OS Kids Fun -- the app that helps kids of every age discover awesome places to hang out in Austin! Designed by 4th graders Olivia and Sidney, this colorful app is like having a friendly tour guide who knows all the best spots in town. Whether you're looking for the tastiest burger, the bounciest trampoline park, or the coolest library, OS Kids Fun has you covered.

## How It Works

When you open the app, three cartoon tour guide characters greet you with a big "Howdy!" Each guide is ready to help different groups of kids find places that are perfect for their age. You pick your age range -- 6-10, 9-14, 13-20, or 19-25 -- and the app shows you places curated just for you. There are colorful category buttons for Restaurants, Sports, Parks, Arts & Crafts, Libraries, and more, so you can jump straight to what excites you. The interactive map lets you see everything nearby with fun themed pins, and you can choose to walk, bike, take the bus, or drive.

## What Makes It Special

Olivia and Sidney put their hearts into making sure no one gets left out. Every age group has its own set of places, and the food section is packed with real Austin favorites like Hat Creek Burger, P. Terry's, Taco Cabana, and JuiceLand -- complete with cute food emoji. Kids can rate places with stars, read reviews from other kids, and check in when they visit to earn credit for exploring their city. The whole idea behind OS Kids Fun is simple and powerful: help kids put down their screens and go discover the amazing real-world places right in their own neighborhood.
