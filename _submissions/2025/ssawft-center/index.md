What if you could experience all four seasons in one place, any time of year? That's what Clark, Rozi, and Harper came up with — the S.S.A.W.F-T Center (Summer, Spring, Autumn, Winter, Fall, and Tree). Their app shows you a nature spot with two big domes: a warm dome with a cafe, obstacle course, and changing rooms, and a cold dome with a sauna, arts and crafts cabin, and cozy sweater-weather vibes. No long drives, no worrying about the weather.

The app helps you plan your whole visit. You can browse activities by dome, filter by age, book tickets, and load money onto a smart wristband so you don't need cash. Parents can sign waivers on their phone, control spending through the wristband, and always know their kids are in a safe space. There are even options for school field trips, private events, and memberships.

The team thought a lot about making things work for both kids and parents. The wristband handles all the money stuff, there's a map showing how to get there by walking, biking, bus, or car, and every screen tries to answer the questions a family would actually have before visiting. Clark, Rozi, and Harper just want more kids to get outside and have fun — without it being a big hassle.
