What if you could experience all four seasons in one place, any time of year? That is the question Clark, Rozi, and Harper set out to answer with the S.S.A.W.F-T Center — short for Summer, Spring, Autumn, Winter, Fall, and Tree. Their app guides kids and families to a one-of-a-kind nature destination featuring two climate-controlled domes: a warm dome with a cafe, obstacle course, and changing rooms, and a cold dome with a sauna, arts and crafts cabin, and cozy sweater-weather vibes. No long drives, no unpredictable weather — just nature, adventure, and fun.

The app does more than just show off the center. It helps you plan your whole visit, from browsing activities by dome and filtering by age, to booking tickets and loading funds onto a smart wristband so you never need to carry cash. Parents can sign waivers digitally, control spending through the wristband account, and feel confident their kids are in a safe, curated space. There are even options for school field trips, private events, and memberships.

What really makes this design stand out is how deeply the team thought about both kid autonomy and parent peace of mind. The wristband economy, the detailed amenities grid, the transit-friendly map with walk, bike, bus, and drive options — every screen is built to answer the question a family would actually ask before visiting. It is nature reimagined for Austin kids, designed by three sixth graders who believe getting off your phone and back to your roots should be easy, safe, and genuinely exciting.
