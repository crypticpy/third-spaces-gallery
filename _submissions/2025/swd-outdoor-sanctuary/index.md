creator_note: "We noticed that kids with physical disabilities often don't have a place that's really designed for them. We imagined a sanctuary where everyone can experience fishing, animal encounters, racing, and friendship -- no matter what your body can do. If Snake Farm can be cool for everyone, why can't we build something even more inclusive?"

Sean, Wyatt, and Daniel are three 6th graders who love animals. They've been to Snake Farm, a local animal sanctuary near Austin, and noticed that while kids with physical disabilities showed up to see the animals, there wasn't really a place made _for_ them. So they imagined one: the SWD Outdoor Sanctuary — an animal sanctuary with fishing, accessible racing tracks, petting zoos with exotic animals, and good food, all designed so kids with disabilities can do everything everyone else can.

## What the App Does

The app makes it easy to find activities that work for you. Right on the home screen you can filter by wheelchair accessible, assistance available, or sensory-friendly, alongside fun stuff like fishing, petting zoo, and racing. The explore screen lets you sort by what you're into and what you need, and instead of confusing labels it uses simple ones like "Easiest First." A color-coded map shows accessible parking, restrooms, water activities, and food spots, with travel times for walking, wheelchair, assisted, or slower pace. Every visit earns you collectible badges like Trail Blazer, Critter Keeper, and Bookworm.

## Built for Everyone

The team thought about more than just physical accessibility. The app has multilingual support and voice-to-text so language doesn't get in the way, medical staff info right on the screen (not hidden somewhere), and ticket pricing that's easy to understand. Sean, Wyatt, and Daniel wanted a place where every kid can have the same kind of fun — no matter what.
