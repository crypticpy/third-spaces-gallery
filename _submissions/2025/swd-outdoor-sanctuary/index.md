creator_note: "We noticed that kids with physical disabilities often don't have a place that's really designed for them. We imagined a sanctuary where everyone can experience fishing, animal encounters, racing, and friendship -- no matter what your body can do. If Snake Farm can be cool for everyone, why can't we build something even more inclusive?"

SWD Outdoor Sanctuary is a passion project from Sean, Wyatt, and Daniel -- three 6th graders who love animals and believe every kid deserves a place where they truly belong. Inspired by visits to Snake Farm, a local animal sanctuary near Austin, the team noticed that while people with physical disabilities came to enjoy the animals, there wasn't a space designed specifically _for_ them. So they imagined one: the SWD Outdoor Sanctuary, an inclusive animal sanctuary featuring fishing, accessible racing tracks, petting zoos with exotic animals, and welcoming food options -- all built with accessibility at the core, not as an afterthought.

## What Makes It Special

The app puts accessibility front and center in every screen. The home dashboard greets users warmly and immediately surfaces accessibility filter chips -- wheelchair accessible, assistance available, sensory-friendly -- right alongside activity categories like fishing, petting zoo, and racing. The explore screen lets kids filter activities by both interest and what their body needs, with positive language like "Easiest First" instead of clinical labels. A color-coded map shows accessible parking, restrooms, water activities, and food spots, with navigation modes for walking, wheelchair, assisted, and slower pace -- each showing realistic travel times. The check-in system turns every visit into an achievement, awarding collectible badges like Trail Blazer, Critter Keeper, and Bookworm that celebrate participation over performance.

## Designed With, Not For

What sets SWD Outdoor Sanctuary apart is its philosophy: the team didn't bolt accessibility onto an existing idea. They designed an entire experience around the principle that kids with disabilities deserve friendship, adventure, and full participation. The app includes multilingual support and voice-to-text so language is never a barrier, medical staff information displayed matter-of-factly rather than hidden away, and tiered ticket pricing that's transparent and visual. As the team puts it, this isn't just a place-finder -- it's a declaration that every kid deserves the full experience of childhood.
