creator_note: "We were just talking about drinks so it just came out like that. It keeps kids hydrated and it's a kid-friendly place so kids can go there if they want. I like it. I think it'll work. If there was a space like this, I'd go a lot."

Slurp It Up is a colorful drink shop and hangout space designed by Luke S., a 6th grader in Austin. Luke noticed that kids don't always have easy access to a welcoming space where they can get hydrated, hang out, and play -- so he imagined a place built from the ground up with kids in mind. The app helps young people discover the full Slurp It Up experience: a rainbow menu of hot and cold drinks, a dedicated toy section with a playhouse, and seating designed for different heights so both kids and adults feel comfortable.

## What Makes It Special

Slurp It Up is not just another drink shop -- it is a true third space where kids can be themselves. Luke thought carefully about the physical details: shorter tables for kids, taller tables for adults, a fountain-style drink station with slurpees, smoothies, hot cocoa, teas, and sodas, plus a whole play area in the back. The app brings all of that to life with a search-and-filter system that lets kids browse drinks by type, a kid-approved badge on every item, and an ordering flow with fun add-ins like gummy bears and sprinkles.

## Getting There and Checking In

The map screen shows exactly how to reach Slurp It Up from school or home, with options for walking, biking, taking the bus, or getting a parent drop-off. Once kids arrive, the place detail screen gives them everything they need: hours, amenities, reviews from other kids, and a big colorful check-in button. Luke's vision is simple and powerful -- a space where hydration meets play, designed by a kid who knows exactly what kids want.
