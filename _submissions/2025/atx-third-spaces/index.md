creator_note: "I designed ATX Third Spaces because teens in Austin don't have one easy place to find spaces that match their interests and accessibility needs. Information is scattered everywhere. I wanted to build something where every teen — especially those with different sensory or mobility needs — can feel confident exploring and know they belong."

ATX Third Spaces is a thoughtfully designed mobile app that helps Austin teens ages 12-18 discover free, safe third spaces across the city. What sets it apart is its wellness-centered approach: instead of just listing places, the app wraps discovery in a calming, supportive experience. From a "Map of Calm" that highlights serene destinations like the Umlauf Sculpture Garden and Blanton Museum of Art, to a built-in Wellness Check-In that asks "How are you feeling today?" before you even start exploring, every screen is designed to make teens feel grounded and welcome.

## Accessibility as the Foundation

Nischal's core design philosophy is that accessibility should never be an afterthought. The app features dedicated filters for wheelchair-accessible spaces, sensory-friendly environments, quiet study spots, and outdoor areas. Category icons for Art & Culture, Parks & Nature, Quiet Study, Mindfulness, and Community Centers let users quickly zero in on spaces that match their needs and mood. Every space listing is designed to answer the question teens actually care about: "Will I feel comfortable when I get there?"

## Wellness Meets Discovery

One of the most original features is the Wellness Check-In, where users can log their mood — Calm, Happy, Thoughtful, Stressed, or Tired — and receive a daily mindfulness prompt before heading out. A weekly tracker and "Calm Streaks" on the profile page turn self-care into a gentle, rewarding habit. Combined with saved places, walking directions via the "Serene Path" toggle, and a soft watercolor visual style that feels warm rather than clinical, ATX Third Spaces reimagines what a discovery app can be when it puts the whole person — not just the destination — at the center.
