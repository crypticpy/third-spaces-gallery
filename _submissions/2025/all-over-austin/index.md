AOA — short for All Over Austin — is Hazel's vision of a calm, beautiful app that helps kids and their pets discover the best third spaces in Austin. With flowing watercolor gradients in blues, teals, and warm peach, every screen feels like opening an artistic notebook. Hazel designed AOA because she knows that when kids search for places online, the results aren't always accurate or age-appropriate. She wanted an app with real descriptions of places she's actually visited, like Wax Bakery and Mueller Lake Park.

## What Makes It Special

AOA's standout feature is its age range filtering — kids can select their age group (1-3, 4-6, 7-9, or 10+) to find spaces that are right for them. There's also a prominent pet-friendly filter, because Hazel believes third spaces should welcome all creatures, not just people. The app organizes places into fun categories like "I Create," "I Eat & Snack," "I Play," and "I Adventure," making it easy to explore by mood without a complicated search.

## Designed with Heart

From the interactive map with custom pins to the detailed place pages with amenities, kid reviews, and a celebratory Check-In button, every part of AOA reflects Hazel's love of symmetry, color, and inclusivity. The watercolor aesthetic isn't just decoration — it's the soul of the app, creating a calm and welcoming experience that makes discovery feel like art.
