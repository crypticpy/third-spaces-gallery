What if you could experience a tropical rainforest, an arctic tundra, or a scorching desert — all without leaving Austin? That is the big idea behind Imagination Cafe, designed by Henry R., a 6th grader with a seriously creative vision. Henry imagined a real-world space where kids use an app (or a kiosk on-site) to customize a room with the climate and environment of their choosing. Then the space actually builds it, and you step inside to experience it with all your senses.

## How It Works

Imagination Cafe is part app, part physical hangout. You start by browsing featured climate rooms — like the Tropical Rainforest Room or the Arctic Expedition — or you go all-in and design your own custom room from scratch. Pick your climate, set the temperature, choose what is inside, and the cafe brings your imagination to life. When your room is ready, you walk in and experience it for real. Not VR. Not a screen. An actual room that feels like a different part of the world.

## More Than Just Rooms

Henry also thought about the details that make a great hangout. There is a cafe up front where you can grab drinks and snacks before or after your climate adventure (just no food inside the rooms). A rating and review system lets kids share which rooms are worth visiting, and video previews show other kids having a blast inside the rooms to get you excited. The app includes a map of Austin with themed pins so you can find the nearest Imagination Cafe location and get directions by walking, biking, bus, or car.

## Why It Matters

The heart of Imagination Cafe is the feeling of accomplishment. Henry put it best: having an idea and watching it become something real is an incredible experience. This design gives every kid the power to be a creator, not just a visitor. It is exploration, imagination, and community all wrapped up in one cozy, climate-hopping cafe.
