Build a Brain is an app that flips the script on how kids with disabilities find places to hang out. Instead of making kids fit into generic spaces, it connects them to activity centers specifically designed for how their brains work. Whether you have ADHD, dyslexia, autism, Down syndrome, or dysgraphia, this app finds your people and your places.

## How It Works

The app starts by asking what kind of brain you have, then curates everything around that. ADHD rooms have high-energy activities with space to run around and burn off steam. Dyslexia rooms tap into imagination with drawing stations and art. Each disability gets activities that treat your brain as a superpower, not a problem. You can search by brain type, activity style, and accessibility needs, or explore an interactive map to see what is close by -- including bus routes for kids who do not have a ride.

## More Than Just a Hangout

What makes Build a Brain truly special is the educational layer. Every activity center includes a digital library that teaches kids about their disability -- what it means, what strengths come with it, and famous people who share it. There is even an audiobook mode for kids who struggle with reading. Fuller and Major wanted kids to go home excited, telling their parents "I just learned something awesome about my brain!" That blend of fun, community, and empowerment is what sets this design apart.
