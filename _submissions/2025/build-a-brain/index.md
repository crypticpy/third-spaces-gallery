Build a Brain helps kids with disabilities find places to hang out that are actually made for them. Instead of trying to fit into spaces that weren't built with you in mind, this app connects you to activity centers designed for how your brain works. Whether you have ADHD, dyslexia, autism, Down syndrome, or dysgraphia, it helps you find your people and your places.

## How It Works

The app asks what kind of brain you have, then shows you stuff based on that. ADHD rooms have high-energy activities with space to run around and burn off steam. Dyslexia rooms have drawing stations and art projects. Each brain type gets activities that match how you think and learn. You can search by brain type, activity style, and what you need for accessibility, or check out the map to see what's nearby — including bus routes if you don't have a ride.

## Learn About Your Brain

Every activity center has a digital library where you can learn about your disability — what it means, what's cool about it, and famous people who have the same thing. There's an audiobook mode too, so you don't have to read everything. Fuller and Major wanted kids to go home and tell their parents, "I just learned something awesome about my brain!" It's a hangout spot and a place to learn at the same time.
