creator_note: "I got this idea from jungle gyms -- they never actually did a jungle for their jungle gym. This place is basically just made for kids who have so much energy and this will be a place to get that energy out."

Vine Time is a jungle gym adventure space with an app designed for kids who love to climb, swing, and challenge themselves. Buck noticed that jungle gyms never actually deliver on the "jungle" promise, so he designed a space where vines are the main event -- not just decoration. The app helps kids discover what's available, watch a safety video, get directions, and check in when they arrive.

## What Makes It Special

The app is packed with features that make visiting Vine Time easy and exciting. A real-time dashboard shows whether the space is open, how crowded it is, and which activity areas are available -- foam pit, climbing wall, swinging vines, snack bar, and more. Kids can search and filter activities by type, age range, and accessibility, so everyone can find their adventure. An interactive map with walking, biking, bus, and driving directions makes getting there simple no matter how you travel.

## Safety Meets Adventure

Buck built safety into the heart of his design. The app features a prominent safety video guide that teaches kids how to use the vines and equipment responsibly -- not as a boring checklist, but as part of the fun. As Buck puts it, the vines are a perfect way to get your energy out, but they come with responsibility. The place detail screen shows amenities, hours, kid reviews, and a celebratory check-in button that makes arriving feel like earning a stamp on your adventure passport.
