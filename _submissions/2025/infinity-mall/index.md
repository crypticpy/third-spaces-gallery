Infinity Mall is a big, fun hub with clubs, activities, and safe spaces for every age and interest. Layla and Stella, two 6th graders from Austin, came up with it because they wanted to help families — especially single parents — find places where kids can have fun and parents always know where they are.

## How It Works

The whole thing runs on a wristband system. When you get to the mall, you scan your wristband to check into a club — the workout gym, cooking club, dance floor, movie theater, or an obstacle-course playroom for when you have a lot of energy. As soon as you check in, your parent or guardian gets a notification with the club name, where it is, and when to pick you up. Activities are sorted by age so younger kids only see what's right for them, and security guards check IDs at the entrance.

## Why They Made It

Layla and Stella were thinking about kids going through tough times — divorce, losing someone, feeling lonely — and wanted a place where those kids could go to have fun and feel like they belong. The app has picture icons for every activity, wheelchair accessibility built in, and filters for cost, distance, and sensory needs. As Layla said: they want every kid to know "there's somewhere safe to go, somewhere fun, somewhere you belong."
