Imagine a place where every kid belongs -- a massive, welcoming hub packed with clubs, activities, and safe spaces for every age and interest. That is Infinity Mall, dreamed up by Layla and Stella, two 6th graders from Austin who wanted to solve a real problem: helping families (especially single parents) find trustworthy places where kids can have fun while parents know exactly where they are.

## How It Works

Infinity Mall centers on a smart wristband system that makes safety feel effortless. When kids arrive, they scan their wristband to check into a club -- whether it is the workout gym, cooking club, dance floor, movie theater, or an obstacle-course playroom for high-energy moments. The instant a kid checks in, their parent or guardian gets a notification with the club name, location, and estimated pick-up time. Activities are age-gated so younger kids see only what is right for them, and security guards verify IDs at the mall entrance. Everything is designed so families can trust the space completely.

## Why It Matters

Layla and Stella built Infinity Mall with heart. They thought about kids going through tough times -- divorce, loss, loneliness -- and wanted to create a place where those kids could escape, explore new interests, and feel like they belong. With visual-first icons for every activity, wheelchair accessibility baked in, and a search experience that filters by cost, distance, and sensory needs, Infinity Mall is not just fun -- it is designed for everyone. As Layla put it during their presentation: they want every kid to know "there's somewhere safe to go, somewhere fun, somewhere you belong."
