creator_note: "Austin has amazing opportunities for youth, but they're scattered and hard to find. I wanted to design WITH kids instead of FOR kids — an app that helps you find not just places, but your people, in spaces where you feel welcome and where you truly belong."

What if finding your next favorite hangout in Austin was as easy as telling an app what you're into? Austin Third Spaces is built around a powerful idea: **design WITH kids instead of FOR kids.** Eric created a comprehensive youth discovery platform where every feature circles back to one question — _How does this help a kid feel like they have a place in Austin and a community of peers who get them?_

## A Belonging Engine, Not Just an App

At its heart, Austin Third Spaces is powered by six standout features. **Go Together** lets you see other youth (ages 10-17) who are planning to visit the same place, so you never have to show up alone. **Interest-Based Discovery** helps you find spaces that match your passions — from art and creativity to gaming, music, sports, and quiet chill zones. **Youth Reviews** give you honest, moderated peer feedback with emoji-based ratings so you know what to expect before you arrive. And **Transportation Made Simple** lays out walking, biking, bus, and driving routes in a clear, youth-friendly way that makes getting there feel doable.

## Accessibility Is the Design, Not an Afterthought

What truly sets this design apart is how it treats inclusion. Accessibility and inclusivity filters are front-and-center search options — not buried in settings. You can filter for wheelchair-accessible, sensory-friendly, LGBTQ+-affirming, multilingual, and free spaces right from the explore screen. Eric's vision ensures that marginalized youth — disabled, trans, immigrant, low-income — see themselves reflected and welcomed. Combined with city challenges, badge rewards, and a check-in system that feels like stamping a passport, Austin Third Spaces turns exploring your city into something genuinely fun and community-building.
