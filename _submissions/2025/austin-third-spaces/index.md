What if finding your next favorite hangout in Austin was as easy as telling an app what you're into? That's what Eric was going for with Austin Third Spaces. He wanted an app that's **designed WITH kids instead of FOR kids** — where every feature helps you find your place in Austin and connect with people who get you.

## What It Does

Austin Third Spaces has some cool features. **Go Together** shows you other youth (ages 10-17) who are planning to visit the same place, so you don't have to show up alone. **Interest-Based Discovery** helps you find spaces that match what you're into — art, gaming, music, sports, or just quiet chill zones. **Youth Reviews** give you honest peer feedback with emoji ratings so you know what to expect. And **Transportation Made Simple** shows walking, biking, bus, and driving routes in a way that actually makes sense.

## Accessibility Built In

Eric made sure accessibility filters aren't buried in some settings menu — they're right on the explore screen. You can filter for wheelchair-accessible, sensory-friendly, LGBTQ+-affirming, multilingual, and free spaces. He wanted kids who are disabled, trans, immigrant, or low-income to see themselves in the app and feel welcome. There are also city challenges, badge rewards, and a check-in system that works like stamping a passport — so exploring Austin is actually fun.
