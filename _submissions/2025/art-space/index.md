Phoebe loves doing pottery at Cordovan Art School & Pottery Parlor in Austin, and she wanted every kid to be able to discover creative spaces like hers. ArtSpace is her answer: a warm, welcoming app built from the ground up with dyslexia-friendly design and bilingual English/Spanish support. Every screen uses large, clear fonts, bullet points instead of paragraphs, and high-contrast colors inspired by clay and earth tones.

## What Makes ArtSpace Special

The heart of ArtSpace is the "What to Expect" feature. Phoebe knows that visiting a new place can feel scary, so each venue page walks you through exactly what happens step by step: walk in, choose your pottery, staff helps you get started, make your art, and they text you when it's ready to pick up. No surprises, no anxiety -- just clear, friendly guidance so every kid feels prepared and welcome.

## Built for Everyone

Phoebe designed ArtSpace with accessibility at the center, not as an afterthought. The search screen includes filters for dyslexia-friendly venues, bilingual staff, wheelchair access, and sensory-friendly spaces. A language toggle on every screen switches between English and Spanish, and an AI chatbot can read information aloud for kids who learn better by listening. From the pottery-themed map pins to the step-by-step check-in process, every detail says: "You belong here, and you can create here."
