Sometimes you don't know exactly what you want to do — you just know how you're feeling. Vibe Finder starts with your mood and finds the perfect place to match.

## The Concept

Instead of searching by activity or location, you tell the app how you're feeling:

- 🎨 **Creative** → Art studios, maker spaces, music rooms
- 📚 **Focused** → Quiet study spots, libraries, peaceful parks
- 🎮 **Playful** → Gaming centers, arcades, sports courts
- 👥 **Social** → Community centers, hangout spots, cafes
- 🧘 **Chill** → Meditation spaces, quiet gardens, relaxation areas

## AI-Powered Suggestions

The app uses AI to learn your patterns:

- If you always pick "creative" after school, it'll have suggestions ready
- Weather affects suggestions (indoor spots when it's rainy)
- Time-aware (different vibes for weekday vs weekend)

## Why This Matters

Teens don't always want to plan ahead. Sometimes you just want to go somewhere that matches your energy right now. Vibe Finder makes that easy.
