## Why Accessibility Matters

About 1 in 4 people have some kind of disability. And lots of Austin families speak languages other than English at home. If Third Spaces is going to work for ALL of Austin, it needs to be accessible to everyone.

## Special Features

1. **Accessibility Verified**: Places earn badges for meeting accessibility standards
2. **Community Reports**: Users can report accessibility issues or improvements
3. **Buddy System**: Connect with others who have similar accessibility needs
4. **Quiet Hours**: Find times when places are less crowded and quieter
