We noticed that kids often don't know about cool places in their neighborhood. Sometimes there are amazing programs happening at the library or rec center, but nobody knows about them!

## Our Solution

Our app lets you:

- **Pick your interests** (gaming, sports, art, music, STEM, etc.)
- **See places nearby** on a colorful, easy-to-read map
- **Get directions** by walking, bus, or car (with parent mode for younger kids)
- **Rate places** and see what other kids think

## Why We Made This

We wanted to make it super easy for kids to find things to do. The map shows everything with fun icons so you can tell at a glance if a place has sports, art, computers, or just a chill hangout spot.

## Special Features

1. **Interest Matching**: The app learns what you like and suggests new places
2. **Kid Reviews**: See ratings from other kids your age, not just adults
3. **Safety First**: Parents can set boundaries and approve destinations
4. **Event Alerts**: Get notified about cool events at your favorite places
