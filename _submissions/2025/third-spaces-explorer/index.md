creator_note: "Sometimes when people are colorblind they can't really see colors as well. It lets them pick what color helps them best. We put pictures next to everything so they don't have to search and do all the investigation — it helps them see what it is quickly. We also put the popular smoothies and the ingredients on them so it helps you prepare and know what to expect. Maybe if kids have dyslexia like we do, then it could read to them."

Emma and Emilia both love Juiceland — it's close to their school and they can walk there. They wished there was an app that showed them places like it and helped them know what to expect before going. Since they both have dyslexia, they designed EPGo (Explore, Pick, GO!) around the stuff that makes things harder for them: colorblindness, menus with too much text, and that nervous feeling when you don't know what a new place will be like.

## The Problem

Kids want to hang out at cool places after school but don't know what's nearby, how to get there, or what to expect. Sometimes there are awesome things happening at the library or rec center, but nobody tells you about them.

## What EPGo Does

- **Pick your colors** — colorblind kids can choose the color palette that works best for their eyes
- **Pictures instead of text** — visual icons for everything so you don't have to read a bunch of words to figure things out
- **See what's popular** — preview popular items with ingredients, so you know what to order before you even get there
- **Plan your route** — get bus or walking directions from school to wherever you're going
- **Talk instead of type** — voice-to-text so you don't have to worry about spelling
- **Listen instead of read** — the app can read everything out loud

## Accessibility Comes First

Emma and Emilia didn't add accessibility on top of a regular app — they built the whole thing around it. Every feature is there because it helps kids with dyslexia, colorblindness, or anxiety about new places. Like Emma said: "It helps kids have their ideas down."

## Features Up Close

1. **Customizable Color Themes**: You can switch between color options including high contrast, deuteranopia-friendly, and protanopia-friendly. Emma said: "Sometimes when people are colorblind they can't really see colors as well. It lets them pick what color helps them best."

2. **Visual Icons**: Every place and thing has a picture so you can understand it fast without reading a ton of text.

3. **Popular Items Preview**: For a place like Juiceland, you can see the most popular smoothies with photos and ingredients — like the Wunder Shwzen (Peanut Butter, Banana, Spinach, Almond Milk, Hemp Protein). It helps you know what to expect so you're not anxious when you get there.

4. **Bus Route Planning**: Not everyone has a car. Emma and Emilia asked, "What if someone wanted to take a bus?" So the app shows you exactly how to get there.

5. **Voice-to-Text & Read Aloud**: Emilia said: "Sometimes I don't know how to spell a word so that helps." And for reading: "Maybe if kids have dyslexia like we do, then it could read to them."

6. **Kid Reviews**: Ratings from other kids, not just adults, so you actually know if a place is fun.
