        <p class="mt-4 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Third Spaces is an app being developed by the City of Austin's Resident Data Impact Project (RIDP) to help young people discover "third places" — spaces beyond home and school where they can hang out, learn, play, and connect with their community.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Think libraries, community centers, parks, rec centers, maker spaces, and more. These are places where Austin youth can find activities, programs, and spaces that match their interests.

        <p class="mt-4 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Students from elementary through high school teamed up to imagine what the Third Spaces app should look like and what features would matter most to them. Now we need your help! Vote for the ideas you love, leave feedback, and help the City of Austin understand what features young people actually want.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy dark:text-gray-100">How These Designs Were Made</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Every design you see here started as a hand-drawn sketch, a written idea, or a concept pitched by a student team. Here's how we brought their visions to life:
        </p>
        <div class="mt-6 space-y-6">
          <div class="flex gap-4">
            <span class="flex h-10 w-10 shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-brand-sky/10 text-lg font-bold text-brand-sky dark:bg-brand-sky/20">1</span>
            <div>
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-brand-navy dark:text-gray-100">Students Dream It Up</h3>
              <p class="mt-1 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                Teams of Austin students brainstormed, sketched, and described their ideal app features — everything from how to find the best hangout spots to wristband check-ins and AI recommendations.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="flex gap-4">
            <span class="flex h-10 w-10 shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-brand-sky/10 text-lg font-bold text-brand-sky dark:bg-brand-sky/20">2</span>
            <div>
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-brand-navy dark:text-gray-100">Our Team Builds the Mockups</h3>
              <p class="mt-1 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                The City of Austin's Create to Code team used AI design tools (like Google Gemini and ChatGPT) to transform those student sketches and ideas into full app screen designs. Think of it like a professional design studio turning rough blueprints into polished visuals.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="flex gap-4">
            <span class="flex h-10 w-10 shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-brand-sky/10 text-lg font-bold text-brand-sky dark:bg-brand-sky/20">3</span>
            <div>
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-brand-navy dark:text-gray-100">Students Give Feedback</h3>
              <p class="mt-1 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                We brought the mockups back to each team for a feedback round. Students told us what looked right, what felt off, and what needed changing — just like working with a real design team.
              </p>
            </div>

        <p class="mt-6 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          <strong class="text-brand-navy dark:text-gray-100">The result?</strong> The designs you see here are a true collaboration between student creativity and modern design tools. The ideas, features, and vision all come from Austin youth.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 italic">
          Some designs are based on imagined physical spaces rather than app screens. For those, our team captured what students loved about their "dream third space" and translated those ideas into features that could live inside a real app.
