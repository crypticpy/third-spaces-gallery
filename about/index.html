        <p class="mt-4 text-brand-stone leading-relaxed">
          Third Spaces is an app being developed by the City of Austin's Resident Data Impact Project (RIDP) to help young people discover "third places" — spaces beyond home and school where they can hang out, learn, play, and connect with their community.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-brand-stone leading-relaxed">
          Think libraries, community centers, parks, rec centers, maker spaces, and more. These are places where Austin youth can find activities, programs, and spaces that match their interests.

          This Youth Design Gallery showcases design ideas created by Austin students through the Create to Code Challenge. These young designers imagined features and interfaces for the Third Spaces app based on what they'd actually want to use.
