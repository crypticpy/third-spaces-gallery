        <p class="mt-4 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Third Spaces is an app the City of Austin is building to help young people find "third places" — the spots beyond home and school where you can hang out, learn, play, and be part of your community.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Think libraries, community centers, parks, rec centers, maker spaces, and more — places where you can find stuff to do that actually matches what you're into.

          This is the Youth Design Gallery — real app ideas created by Austin students as part of the <strong class="text-brand-navy dark:text-gray-100">Create to Code Challenge</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Students from elementary through high school teamed up to imagine what the Third Spaces app should look like and what features would matter most. Now we need your help! Vote for the ideas you love, leave feedback, and help us figure out what young people actually want in this app.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy dark:text-gray-100">How These Designs Were Made</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Every design you see here started as a hand-drawn sketch, a written idea, or a pitch from a student team. Here's how we turned their ideas into what you see now:
        </p>
        <div class="mt-6 space-y-6">
          <div class="flex gap-4">
            <span class="flex h-10 w-10 shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-brand-sky/10 text-lg font-bold text-brand-sky dark:bg-brand-sky/20">1</span>
            <div>
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-brand-navy dark:text-gray-100">Students Dream It Up</h3>
              <p class="mt-1 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                Teams of Austin students brainstormed, sketched, and described their ideal app features — everything from how to find the best hangout spots to wristband check-ins and AI recommendations.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="flex gap-4">
            <span class="flex h-10 w-10 shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-brand-sky/10 text-lg font-bold text-brand-sky dark:bg-brand-sky/20">2</span>
            <div>
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-brand-navy dark:text-gray-100">Our Team Builds the Mockups</h3>
              <p class="mt-1 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                Our Create to Code team used AI design tools (like Google Gemini and ChatGPT) to turn those sketches and ideas into full app screen designs. Think of it like having an artist take your rough drawing and make it look like a real app.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="flex gap-4">
            <span class="flex h-10 w-10 shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-brand-sky/10 text-lg font-bold text-brand-sky dark:bg-brand-sky/20">3</span>
            <div>
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-brand-navy dark:text-gray-100">Students Give Feedback</h3>
              <p class="mt-1 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                We brought the mockups back to each team for a feedback round. Students told us what looked right, what felt off, and what needed changing — just like working with a real design team.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="mt-6 text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          <strong class="text-brand-navy dark:text-gray-100">The result?</strong> What you see here is a team effort — students came up with the ideas, and design tools helped make them look real. The creativity and vision? That's all Austin youth.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-brand-stone dark:text-gray-400 italic">
          Some teams imagined physical spaces instead of app screens. For those, our team took what students loved about their "dream third space" and figured out how those ideas could work inside an app.
