      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>Voting Data</h3>
      <p>When you vote on designs, we collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vote selections</strong> - Which designs you voted for and in which categories</li>

        <li><strong>Timestamp</strong> - When you voted</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is stored locally in your browser and optionally synced to our servers for vote aggregation. We do not collect your name, email, or any personal contact information through voting.
      </p>

      <h3>Feedback & Comments</h3>
      <p>
        If you leave feedback or comments, we collect the content you submit. Comments are powered by GitHub Discussions and require a GitHub account. GitHub's privacy policy applies to comment data.
      </p>

      <h3>Design Submissions</h3>
      <p>
        If you submit a design, we collect the information you provide in the submission form, including your first name, school, and grade level. This information will be displayed publicly alongside your design.

      </ul>

      <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
      <p>
        Vote data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage and cookies. If server-side aggregation is enabled, vote data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or transfer your information to third parties, except as required by law.
